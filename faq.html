     <h1>FAQ</h1>

	    <h2>Logistics</h2>
<h4><a id="Does_Hack_to_the_Future_run_all_night_1"></a>Does Hack to the Future run all night?</h4>
<p>Hack to the Future runs 24 hours from 11:00am ET on November 3 to 11:00am ET on November 4. Offices will be open all night, and you can sleep here if you want! Hack demos will then take place on Friday, November 4.</p>
<br />
	    <h4><a id="Do_we_have_to_work_through_the_entire_24_hour_period_4"></a>Do we have to work through the entire 24 hour period?</h4>
<p>No, you can work on your hack as much as you want. We will also have office activities late into the evening on November 3 we encourage you to check out.</p>
<br /><h4><a id="Will_you_provide_snacks_and_refreshments_7"></a>Will you provide snacks and refreshments?</h4>
<p>Yes! We’ll be serving lunch, dinner, breakfast, and snacks during the 24 hour event.</p>
<br /><h4><a id="Is_it_mandatory_10"></a>Is it mandatory?</h4>
<p>No, but we encourage everyone to participate if your schedule and workload allows. If you do not wish to join a pitch or hack team, you can check out the other fun activities happening throughout the day and evening (varies by office).</p>
<br /><h4><a id="What_if_my_regular_job_duties_prevent_me_from_participating_13"></a>What if my regular job duties prevent me from participating?</h4>
<p>Please talk to your manager to see if together you can make it work. You may participate for just part of the day if that works better with your schedule.</p>
<br /><h4><a id="Does_my_project_have_to_work_16"></a>Does my project have to “work?”</h4>
<p>No, you can have your project as realized as you want it to be, from an initial prototype to a fully working hack.</p>
<br /><h4><a id="Hacks__Teams_19"></a>Hacks &amp; Teams</h4>
<p>How will the company use my hack or pitch?
The hack/pitch will be showcased on this website post event. We will refer to these when thinking of the product roadmap and new company initiatives.</p>
<br /><h4><a id="What_are_some_examples_of_hacks_and_pitches_23"></a>What are some examples of hacks and pitches?</h4>
<p>New workflow tools for customers
New catalog features for contributors
Sales call-a-thon</p>
<br /><h4><a id="Does_my_hack_have_to_be_technical_or_related_to_the_website_28"></a>Does my hack have to be technical or related to the website?</h4>
<p>Ideally your hack will be code-based with the goal of improving our company products or services.</p>
<br /><h4><a id="What_if_there_are_no_programmers_on_my_team_31"></a>What if there are no programmers on my team?</h4>
<p>You don’t need to code to demo a pitch idea and if you have trouble finding a programmer for your team, we encourage you to fill out a matchmaking form and the event organizers will help you find a team. Every hack team needs non-technical talent to build out the idea even further!
How will I know if my idea has been hacked together already?
Check out ideas from 2011, 2012 and 2013. Feel free to iterate on anything you see!</p>

If your Hack team has a minimum of 4 people from at least 4 different departments, fill out the <a href="/registration.html">Hack Team Registration form</a>.</p>
<br /><h4><a id="If_I_register_my_team_early_will_I_get_to_present_early_during_the_demo_event_56"></a>If I register my team early, will I get to present early during the demo event?</h4>
<p>Not necessarily. Demo presentation order will be rearranged by the event organizers…</p>
<br /><h4><a id="What_will_the_demo_schedule_be_like_59"></a>What will the demo schedule be like?</h4>
<p>Pitch demos begin at 10:30am (ET) on Thursday, November 3 at Shutterstock HQ in the Empire State Building. Teams can demo from other offices/remote as well.
Hack demos begin at 11:00am (ET) on Friday, November 4 at Shutterstock HQ in the Empire State Building. We’ll have a laptop that should be able to access dev and QA environments. As each team presents, there will be two other teams “on deck” setting up. We will have a Macbook Pro laptop, from which teams will present. Between demos, we’ll announce who’s on deck to get ready, so it’s important for you to pay attention and listen for your team to be called. If your team is remote, you will demo live from your location via hangout (similar to Sprint Demo).</p>
<br /><h4><a id="Can_I_present_my_demo_from_my_own_laptop_63"></a>Can I present my demo from my own laptop?</h4>
<p>NO. If you are at Shutterstock HQ in the Empire State Building, you MUST use one of the Macbook Pros we provide to allow a seamless presentation experience for the audience. If you are presenting from another location, please use the laptop provided by your respective AV team.</p>
<br /><h4><a id="How_much_time_will_I_have_to_present_my_Hack_66"></a>How much time will I have to present my Hack?</h4>
<p>Each team will have exactly 2 minutes to present their hack project. You are strongly encouraged to practice this presentation.</p>
<br /><h4><a id="Will_there_be_prizes_69"></a>Will there be prizes?</h4>
<p>Each hack will be judged during the demos according to the different categories. Winners of each category will be recognized with a prize (TBD).</p>
<br /><h4><a id="Do_I_need_to_practice_my_presentation_72"></a>Do I need to practice my presentation?</h4>
<p>YES! We can’t repeat this enough! Keep in mind that you will have one chance to present to the judges. The more you practice, the better the presentation will go.</p>
<br /><h4><a id="How_will_I_know_when_my_2_minutes_are_up_75"></a>How will I know when my 2 minutes are up?</h4>
<p>During your team’s presentation, look for the iPad with a timer to see how much time you have left to present. (When there are 30 seconds left, the digits will turn yellow; when there are 10 seconds left, the digits will turn red. If you go overtime, the background will turn red.)</p>
<br /><h4><a id="Can_I_show_a_video_at_Hack_to_the_Future_78"></a>Can I show a video at Hack to the Future?</h4>
<p>Yes! In the past we’ve had teams make funny videos of new features they’d like to see implemented on the site. We’ve also had remote teams make videos so that they wouldn’t have to worry about logistics and bandwidth of doing a presentation. If you are showing a video during your demo, we highly recommend you bring it on a thumb drive or other storage medium rather than trying to stream it over the network. Video at 1080p is fine to use. All presentation laptops at ESB will be Macbook Pros, so please bring a video format compatible to that device. When presenting, make sure to full screen your video on the presentation laptop to provide the best viewing experience for the audience. Don’t leave the video playback controls on the screen when it is playing; please move the mouse pointer away from the controls in QuickTime player and they will disappear after a few seconds.</p>
